Something magical happens when pets and people connect. An extraordinary bond is formed that results in something powerful, not only between pets and people but also in a way that makes the world a better place.

Every pet has something special to offer their owners, but with such unique personalities and backgrounds, many new pet-owner pairs find the initial transition period following adoption to be difficult. Over 1 million households turn to pet rehoming each year, with the first month being the most vital in initiating a strong and healthy bond. We’d like to limit the rate of pet rehoming by leading users through this essential learning process, and by supporting and strengthening the bond between pets and owners to help establish meaningful, irreplaceable relationships.

PetSetGo! will provide users with essential training, customized activity and goal recommendations, and weekly progression of their pet’s behavior to make the settling-in period simpler and understandable. We also provide a timeline of pets’ and owners’ most special memories together, so that users can embrace their ever-growing friendships with their one of a kind shelter pet.

Adopting a pet can be difficult, but is always rewarding; we want to help you build a strong foundation for your new journey together.
